# apeiron

apeiron is a personal workflow application for creating photographic works.

This repository contains an experimental and evolving implementation of my own photographic production workflow.

## What is apeiron

I previously managed my photographic work by connecting multiple applications.
As my practice expanded to include production notes, that workflow became fragmented and difficult to maintain.

apeiron is an attempt to consolidate that process into a single application:
not for editing images, but for recording decisions, thoughts, and structure around photographic works.

This project is developed primarily for my own use.
Public release is intended for transparency, experimentation, and long-term documentation.

## What apeiron is **not**

apeiron is **not** a photo editor.  
apeiron is **not** an automatic curation tool.  
apeiron is **not** a social platform.

The application focuses on workflow, structure, and reflection — not image processing or engagement.

## What you can do with apeiron

- Manage photographic materials
- Organize works and series
- Create and maintain production notes
- Request and record reviews
- Edit and structure zines
- Publish works as a static portfolio

---

## What you cannot do with apeiron

- Edit photos
- Automatically select or rate photos
- Collect public comments on published portfolios
- Create highly elaborate zine layouts

These limitations are intentional.

## Usage and availability

You are free to build, install, and use this application yourself.

The project is released under the Apache License 2.0.
Future distribution (e.g. mobile apps or hosted services) may involve cost recovery,
but the core application is intended to remain free to use.

## Project status

apeiron is under active development.

Features may be incomplete, revised, or removed as the workflow evolves.
Backward compatibility is **not guaranteed** at this stage.

If you are looking for a stable, general-purpose photography tool,
this project is probably not suitable for you.

---

## Philosophy

apeiron reflects my own photographic practice.
It is not designed to fit every workflow.

If you need a tool tailored to your own practice,
building or adapting your own workflow may be the better option.
